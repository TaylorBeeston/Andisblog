# Andi's Blog

This is a simple blog for my wife! I plan to use [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com/)
for a text editor, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the front end, and
an [Express](https://expressjs.com/)/[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
back end!

---

I haven't done much database work with Node.js yet, and I have also never used
Quill before, so this project should prove to be an excellent learning experience
for me!
